# FACIAL KEYPOINTS DETECTION

https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

* Determine x,y of keypoints in image (e.g. left eye cornewer)
* 30 regression outputs (x,y of 15 labels)
* Practice Convoutional Neural Networks

## How to use this repo

* Find location for important codes from this README
* Save important codes for the team under **/production_code**, feel free to add any subdirectories if necessary
* Save your own exploratory code under **/individual_code**, there is a directory under your name
* Refrain from pushing large datasets to this repo. Usually people keep code and data in separate drives. This also prevents another member from cloning a heavy repo to a small instance or local computer
* To share any intermediate datasets, you can save it to another cloud location and provide a link in this README
* Please take authorship in this repo. Improve its structure, fill it with contents, expand the README(s)
